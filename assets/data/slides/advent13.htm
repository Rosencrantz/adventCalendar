<h1>...And very briefly, plugins</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to bundle reusable application code</li>
  <li>Plugins help keep the sammy core small whilst allowing the inclusion of desired features</li>
  <li>A sammy plugin is really just a sammy application that's only evaluated when needed</li>
  <li>We include plugins in out applications by using the <em>use()</em> method</li>
  <li>The use method takes the plugin and evaluates it in the context of the current function</li>
</ul>
