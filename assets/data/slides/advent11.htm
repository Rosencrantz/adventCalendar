<h1>Getting around with around</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>around</em> method is a great way of allowing us to check the current route before we execute it</li>
  <li>As the name suggests the <em>around</em> method wraps around each of our routes and is evaluated prior to route execution</li>
  <li><em>around</em> takes a single argument callback which is the route execution path wrapped up in a closure</li>
</ul>
