<h1>Getting around with around</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The around function is a great way of allowing us to check the current route before we execute it</li>
  <li>As the name suggests the around function wraps around each of our routes and is evaluated prior to route execution</li>
  <li>around takes a single anonymous function which is passed the route to be used as a callback</li>
</ul>
