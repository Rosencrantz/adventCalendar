	<li>Sammy.Application is the base prototype for defining applications. When creating a sammy application we use <em>$.sammy()</em></li>
	<li>An application is a collection of routes and bound events that are attached to an element when <em>.run()</em> is called</li>
	<li><em>Sammy.Application</em> requires single argument <em>app_function</em> that is evaluated within the context of the application</li>
	<li>Also takes and optional argument that is the element to which you want to attach the application</li>
	<li>Within the context of the application <em>this</em> relates to the application itself</li>
