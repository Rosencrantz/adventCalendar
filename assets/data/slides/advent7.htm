<h1>Making it useful. Defining some routes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Routes are the main building blocks of a sammy application</li>
  <li>A route is made up of a verb, a path and a callback function</li>
  <li>The verb can be one of: 'get', 'post', 'put' or 'delete. Of these 'get' is the most commonly used because...</li>
  <li>'post', 'put' and 'delete' are only invoked on form submission</l1>
  <li>Within the callback of a route 'this' is a new <em>Sammy.EventContext</em>. This has a number of handy methods and attributes like <em>redirect</em> or <em>render</em></li>
</ul>
