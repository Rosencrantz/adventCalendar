<h1>Events. Defining, binding and triggering</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Events in sammy are designed to be created in the same way as in jQuery</li>
  <li>Internally events are bound to the application within a unique application namespace</li>
  <li>This means you can run multiple sammy applications without having to worry about multiple events being triggered</li>
  <li><em>bind</em> creates a handler for an event</li>
  <li><em>trigger</em> causes an event to be raised, can be raised within the context of the application or within other events/routes</li>
</ul>
