<h1>Making it useful. Defining some routes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Routes are the main building blocks of a sammy application</li>
  <li>A route is made up of a verb, a path and a callback function</li>
  <li>The verb can be one of: <em>get</em>, <em>post</em>, <em>put</em> or <em>delete</em>. Of these <em>get</em> is the most commonly used because...</li>
  <li><em>post</em>, <em>put</em> and <em>delete</em> are only invoked on form submission</l1>
  <li>Within the callback of a route <em>this</em> is a new <em>Sammy.EventContext</em>. This has a number of handy methods and attributes like <em>redirect</em> or <em>render</em></li>
</ul>
